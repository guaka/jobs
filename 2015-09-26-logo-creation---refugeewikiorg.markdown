refugeewiki.org is an open, common license platform collecting
important information for refugees, organizations and volunteers.

We need a logo!

We want to give advice for refugees, on the asylum process in Europe
and to help get in touch with local aid organizations.  On the other
hand we want to give advice on how to get involved as a volunteer and
help organizations to connect and build a strong network amongst
everyone involved.
